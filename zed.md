# Zed editor waitlist application

https://zed.dev/waitlist

What programming languages do you use?

> Languages: Rust, Go, Shell, Whitespace, many esoteric languages

Tell us a bit about yourself and your interest in Zed. What does your dream
code-editing experience look like? What do you love or hate about your current
editor?

> I've been using VSCode since its early days, because I wanted a minimal, yet
> easily-extensible editor, but its performance issues have me wanting to
> switch—Zed seems like it could have what I want.
>
> Here's my wish list:
> - extension API that makes it easy for language authors; not JS-based
> - highly-customizable, text-based settings in a format like JSON
> - minimalist philosophy closer to an editor than an IDE
> - high performance
> - integrated terminal, git, and diff tools
> - font ligatures, e.g., with FiraCode; I have much feedback I could give here
>
> VSCode has most of these, but the performance is abysmal and the
> previously-first-class JSON-based settings experience has been downgraded as
> “legacy” in favor of clunky UI-based settings.
>
> I am a language author and maintain tools for the Whitespace programming
> language, so editor language tooling is very important to me.
