## `std::fmt::Debug`

Did you know that the Formatter argument to `Debug::fmt` makes it *really* easy
to customize debug representations for structs, enums, lists, and sets? See the
`debug_*` methods on it.

## `Formatter`

Did you know that `std::fmt::Formatter` is *super* easy to use if you want more
control over debugging for a custom type? For example, to emit a “list-like”
type, just `Formatter::debug_list().entries(self.0.iter()).finish()`.

## `Option<T>`

Did you know that `Option<T>` implements `IntoIterator` yielding 0/1 elements,
and you can then call `Iterator::flatten` to make that be 0/n elements if T:
IntoIterator?

## `type EmptyTupleList = Vec<()>`

Did you know that since `()` is a zero-sized type, and the vector never actually
has to store any data, the capacity of `Vec<()>` is `usize::MAX`!

## `T`

Did you know that `T` doesn’t imply ownership? When we say a type is generic
over `T`, that `T` can just as easily be a reference to something on the stack,
and the type system will still be happy. Even `T: 'static` doesn’t imply owned —
consider `&'static str` for example.

[Reminds me of this [excellent article](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/common-rust-lifetime-misconceptions.md)
-Jimmy]

## `std::sync::mpsc::channel::Sender`

Did you know that `std::sync::mpsc` has had a [known bug since 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39364),
and that the implementation may actually be replaced entirely with the crossbeam
channel implementation? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93563

## `u128`

Did you know that even though we got `u128` a long time ago now, we still don’t
have `repr(128)`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56071

## `std::ffi::OsString`

Did you know that there are per-platform extension traits for `OsString` that
bake in the assumptions you can safely make on that platform? Such as
[strings being `[u8]` on Unix](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/ffi/trait.OsStringExt.html)
and [UTF-16 on Windows](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/windows/ffi/trait.OsStringExt.html).

## `std::ptr::NonNull`

Did you know that one of the super neat features of `NonNull` is that it enables
the same niche optimization that regular references and the `NonZero*` types get
where `Option<NonNull<T>>` is the same size as `*mut T`?

## `Cow<T>`

Did you know that there used to be a special `IntoCow` trait, but it was
deprecated before 1.0 was released!
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27735

## `Box<T>`

Did you know that `Box<T>` is a `#[fundamental]` type, which means that it’s
exempt from the normal rules that don’t allow you to implement foreign traits
for foreign types (assuming T is a local type)?

## `std::process::Child`

Did you know that `std` has [three different ways](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/src/sys/unix/process/process_unix.rs)
to spawn a child process on Linux (`posix_spawn`, `clone3`/`exec`,
`fork`/`exec`) depending on what capabilities your kernel version has?

## `Pin<T>`

Did you know that the name `Pin` (and the name `Unpin`) where both *heavily*
debated? Pin was almost called Pinned, for example. [The discussion](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55766#issuecomment-438789462)
is an interesting read now after the fact.

## `Vec<T>`

Did you know that `Vec::swap_remove` is *way* faster than `Vec::remove` if you
can tolerate changes to ordering?

Did you know that the smallest non-zero capacity for a `Vec<T>`
[depends on the size of `T`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9a74608543d499bcc7dd505e195e8bfab9447315/library/alloc/src/raw_vec.rs#L106-L110)?

## `CStr`

Did you know that `CStr::default` creates a `CStr` that points to a const string
`"\0"` stored in the binary text segment, which means all default `CStr`s point
to the same (non-null) string!

## `for<'a> SomeTrait<'a>`

Did you know that you can use `for<'a>` to say that a bound has to hold for
*any* lifetime `'a`, not just a *specific* lifetime you happen to have available
at the time. For example, `<T> for<'a>: &'a T: Read` says that *any* shared
reference to a `T` must implement `Read`.

## [`This monstrous warp type`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/fasterthanlime/de0955a8b29d0d66110983ebb5fae442/raw/1827a3afbca01cd42eafd0905cfdc451da805cb7/gistfile1.txt)

Did you know that the trailing commas you see in some places in there, `,)`, are
to [distinguish one-element tuples from regular parenthetical expressions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/expressions/tuple-expr.html)?

## `FnOnce`

Did you know that until Rust 1.35, you couldn’t call a `Box<dyn FnOnce>` and
needed a special type (`FnBox`) for it! This was because it requires “unsized
rvalues” to implement, which are still unstable today.
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/28796 +
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48055

## `f32`

Did you know that in Rust 1.62 we’ll get a deterministic ordering function for
floating point numbers? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/95431

## `Arc<T>`

Did you know that `Arc` has a `make_mut` method that effectively gives you
copy-on-write? Given a `&mut Arc<T>`, it will either give you `&mut T` if there
are no other `Arc`s, or it will clone `T`, make the `Arc<T>` point to that new
`T`, and then give you a `&mut` to it!

## `!`

Did you know that `std::convert::Infallible` is the “original” `!`, and that the
plan is to one day replace `Infallible` with a type alias for `!`?

## `fn`

Specifically, did you know that the name of a function is *not* an `fn`? It’s a
`FnDef`, which can then be [coerced to a `FnPtr`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86654#issuecomment-869173835)?

## `PhantomData`

Did you know that it’s actually kind of tricky to define `PhantomData` yourself:
https://github.com/dtolnay/ghost

## `u32`

Did you know that `u32` now has associated constants for `MIN` and `MAX`, so you
no longer need to use `std::u32::MIN` and can use `u32::MIN` directly instead?

## `bool`

Did you know that bool isn’t just “stored as a byte”, the compiler straight up
declares its representation as [the same as that of u8](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_middle/src/ty/layout.rs#L676-L682)?

## `Any`

Did you know that `Any` is *really* non-magical? It just has a blanket
implementation for all `T` that returns `TypeId::of::<T>()`, and to downcast it
simply compares the return value of that trait method to see if it’s safe to
cast to downcast to a type! `TypeId` *is* magic though.

## `Self`

Did you know that `fn foo(self)` is syntactic sugar for `fn foo(self: Self)`,
and that one day you’ll be able to use other types for `self` that involve
`Self`, like `fn foo(self: Arc<Self>)`?
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44874

## `()`

Did you know that `()` implements `FromIterator`, so you can
`.collect::<Result<(), E>>` to *just* see if anything in an iterator erred?

[Note that this doesn’t say whether or not this is a good idea. -Jimmy]

## `struct S`

Did you know that `struct S` implicitly declares a constant called `S`, which is
why you can make one using just `S`?

## `RefCell`

Did you know that RefCell allows you to replace a value in-place directly (like
`std::mem::replace`)?
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html#method.replace

## `core::num::Wrapping`

Did you know that there used to also be a trait accompanying `Wrapping`,
`WrappingOps`, that was removed last minute before 1.0?
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/23549

## `*const T`

Did you know that, at least for the time being, `*const T` and `*mut T` are more
or less equivalent?
https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/257

## `std::os::unix::net::UnixStream`

Did you know that (on nightly) you can pass UNIX file descriptors over
UnixStreams too, and thereby [give another process access](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/net/struct.SocketAncillary.html#method.add_fds)
to a file it may not otherwise be able to open?

## `std::sync::Condvar`/`Mutex`

Did you know that Mara is doing some *awesome* work on making `Condvar` (and
`Mutex` and `RwLock`) much better on a wide array on platforms?
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93740

## `std::task::Waker`

Did you know that `Waker` is secretly just a `dyn std::task::Wake + Clone` done
in a way that doesn’t require a wide pointer or support for multi-trait dynamic
dispatch? See https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/task/struct.RawWakerVTable.html

## `impl Trait`

Did you know that `impl Trait` in argument position and `impl Trait` in return
position represent completely different type constructs, even though they “feel”
related? https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/reference/types/impl-trait.html

## `BTreeMap<K, V>`

Did you know that `BTreeMap` is one of the few collections that still doesn’t
have a `drain` method? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81074

## `struct InvariantLifetime<'id>(PhantomData<*mut &'id ()>);`

Did you know that `PhantomData<T>` has variance like `T`, and `*mut T` is
invariant over `T`, and so by placing a lifetime inside `T` you make the outer
type invariant over that lifetime?

## `Rc<T>`

Did you know that the `Rc` type was among the arguments for why
`std::mem::forget` shouldn’t be marked as unsafe?
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24456

## `std::future::Ready`

Did you know that these days you can just use `async move { x }` instead of
`future::ready(x)`. The main reason to still use `future::ready(x)` is that you
can name the future it returns, which is harder with `async` (without
`type_alias_impl_trait` that is).

## `usize`

Did you know that `usize` isn’t really “the size of a pointer”. Instead, it’s
more like “the size of a pointer address difference”, and the two can be fairly
different! https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95228

## `std::thread::Thread`

Did you know that the `ThreadId` that’s available for each `Thread` is entirely
a `std` construct? Creating a `ThreadId` simply increments a global static
counter under a lock.

## `std::ops::ControlFlow`

Did you know that `ControlFlow` is really a stepping stone towards making `?`
work for other types than `Option` and `Result`? The full design has gone
through a *lot* of iterations, but the latest and greatest is
[RFC3058](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/84277).

## `File`

Did you know that there are implementations of `Read`, `Write`, and `Seek` for
`&File` as well, so multiple threads can share a single `File` and call those
concurrently. Whether they *should* is a different question of course.

## `Result<T, E>`

Did you know that Rust originally (pre-1.0) had both Result *and* an Either
type? They decided to remove Either [way back in 2013](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/9157)

## `Cow<str>`

Did you know that because `Cow<'a, T>` is covariant in `'a`, you can always
assign `Cow::Borrowed("some string")` to one no matter what it originally held?

## `PanicInfo`

Did you know that since `PanicInfo` is in core, its `Display` implementation
cannot access the panic data if it’s a `String` (since it can’t name that type),
so trying to print the `PanicInfo` after a
`std::panic::panic_any(format!("x y z"))` won’t print `"x y z"`?
[Source link.](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/352e621368c31d7b4a6362e081586cdb931ba020/library/core/src/panic/panic_info.rs#L159-L162)

## `std::ffi::c_void`

Did you know that the whole `c_void` type is a collection of hacks to try to
work around the lack for extern types?
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43467

## `#[feature(raw_ref_op)] &raw const T`

Definitely cheating :p But did you know that originally the intention was to
have `&const raw` variable be just a MIR construct and let
`&variable as *const _` be automatically changed to `&const raw`?
https://github.com/RalfJung/rfcs/blob/fd4b4cd769300cfde5d54865d227990b71b762d1/text/0000-raw-reference-operator.md

## `u256`

Did you know that because Rust compiles through LLVM, we’re sort of constrained
to the primitive types LLVM supports, and [LLVM itself only goes up to 128](https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1Type.html#pub-static-methods)?

## `_`

Did you know that whether or not `let _ = x` should move `x` is actually fairly
subtle? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10488

## `MaybeUninit`

Did you know that `MaybeUninit` arose because the previous mechanism,
`std::mem::uninitialized`, produced *immediate* undefined behavior when invoked
with *most* types (like `uninitialized::<bool>()`).

## `struct T<const C: usize>`

Did you know that with Rust 1.59.0 you can now [give `C` a default value](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/02/24/Rust-1.59.0.html#const-generics-defaults-and-interleaving)?

## `Weak<T>`

Did you know that actual deallocation logic for `Arc<T>` is implemented in
`Weak<T>`, and is invoked by considering all copies of a particular `Arc<T>` to
*collectively* hold a single `Weak<T>` between them? [Source link](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/7e9b92cb43a489b34e2bcb8d21f36198e02eedbc/library/alloc/src/sync.rs#L1108-L1109).

## `[T; N]`

Did you know that while *most* trait implementations for arrays now use const
generics to impl for any length `N`, [we can’t *yet* do the same for `Default`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e40d5e83dc133d093c22c7ff016b10daa4f40dcf/library/core/src/array/mod.rs#L371-L394).

## `u8`

Did you know that as of Rust 1.60, you can now use `u8::escape_ascii` to
[get an iterator of the bytes needed to escape that byte character in *most* contexts](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ascii/fn.escape_default.html).

## `HashMap<K, V>`

Did you know that the Rust devs are working on a “raw” entry API for `HashMap`
that allows you to (unsafely) avoid re-hashing a key you’ve already hashed?
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/56167

## `&mut T`

Did you know that while `&mut T` is defined as meaning “mutable reference” in
the Rust reference, you’re often better off thinking of it as “mutually
exclusive reference”. [Quoth David Tolnay](https://docs.rs/dtolnay/latest/dtolnay/macro._02__reference_types.html).

## `std::ops::Range`

Did you know that there’s been a *lot* of debate around whether or not the
`Range` types should be `Copy`? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/21846

## `AtomicU32`

Did you know that you’ll often want `compare_exchange_weak` over
`compare_exchange` to get [more efficient code on ARM cores](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180329-00/?p=98375).

## `std::ops::Hash`

Did you know that Hash is responsible for not just
[one](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29263) , but
[*two*](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65744) of the issues on the
“rust 2 breakage wishlist”?

## `{integer}`

Did you know that fasterthanlime’s [most recent article](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-curse-of-strong-typing#different-kinds-of-numbers)
does a great job at explaining `{integer}`?

## `Fn`

Did you know that until Rust 1.35.0, `Box<T> where T: Fn` did not `impl Fn`, so
you couldn’t (easily) call boxed closures!
https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55431

## `((), ())`

Did you know that `((), ())` and `()` have the same hash? [Playground link.](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=894b78e8ee2721440aa8dea5e35f9dc3)

## `[T]`

Did you know that `&[u8]` implements `Read` and `Write`? So for anything that
takes `impl Read`, you can provide `&mut` slice instead! Comes in handy for
testing. Note that the slice itself is shortened for each read, hence
`&mut &[u8]`.

## `*`

Did you know that `*` is (mostly) just syntax sugar for the std::ops::Mul trait?

## `UnsafeCell<T>`

Did you know that `UnsafeCell` is one of those types that the compiler needs
“special magic” for because it has to instruct LLVM to *not* assume Rust’s
normal aliasing rules hold once code traverses the boundary of any `UnsafeCell`?

## `TcpStream`

Did you know that in its default configuration, `TcpStream` uses
[Nagle’s Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle%27s_algorithm) to
schedule packet sends, which can introduce unfortunate latency spikes. If you’re
particularly latency sensitive, consider calling `TcpStream::set_nodelay(true)`.
