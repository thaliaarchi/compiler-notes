## Benchmarks

The PLDI'17 paper's suite of 24 benchmarks were designed to measure
polyhedral loop optimization effectivity, so are small scientific
computing programs (~100 LOC), not full applications. This paper uses
more representative benchmarks that are compiled with Browserix-Wasm.

Browserix implements a Unix-compatible kernel in JS with full support
for processes, files, pipes, blocking I/O, and other Unix features. This
paper extends Browserix as Browserix-Wasm, to compile Unix programs to
Wasm without modifications.

## Performance gaps

### More loads and stores

Code generated from WebAssembly has more loads and stores than native
code due to:
- Reduced register availability (§5.1.2)
  - Some registers are reserved by browser for JS GC root, heap, and
    scratch registers (§6.1.1)
- Sub-optimal register allocation (§5.1.2)
  - Chrome and Firefox use linear scan register allocators (like Graal),
    while Clang uses a greedy graph-coloring register allocator, which
    consistently generates better code (§6.1.2)
- Not effectively exploiting a wider range of x86 addressing modes
  - e.g., `mov ecx, [rbx+rdx*1]; add ecx, r15d; mov [rbx+rdx*1], ecx`
    instead of `add [rdi + rcx*4 + 4*NJ], ebx` (§5.1.1)
  - Chrome does not use x86-64 memory addressing modes like register
    indirect or direct offset addressing, where the operand resides in a
    memory address and the instruction can read/write to that address
    (§6.1.3)

### More branches

Code generated from WebAssembly has more branches due to:
- Extra loop jump statements (§6.2.1)
  - e.g., from not inverting loops (§5.1.3)
- Stack overflow checks per function call (§6.2.2)
  - Every function call increases the stack size global variable and
    checks that it's less than the max stack size, which adds extra
    comparison and jump instructions
- Function table indexing checks
  - Indirect call targets are dynamically-checked for type validity via
    the function table, which adds extra comparison and jump
    instructions

### Increased code size

Code generated from WebAssembly has more L1 instruction cache misses due
to the extra instructions from more register spills (poor register
allocation) and extra branches (§6.3)
