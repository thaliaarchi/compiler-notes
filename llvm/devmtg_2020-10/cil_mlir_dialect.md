CIL, pronounced "seal".

Types have a very close correspondence with C types and are target
independent.

Unstructured control flow like `break`, `continue`, and `goto` needs
another pass to convert to `affine.for`.

`cil.class` is an operation with a region and methods can be lowered to
regular functions.

With CIL, LLVM is finally able to eliminate `v.push(); v.pop();` after
so many years.

## Questions

Q: Are STL types like `std::vector` or `std::map` represented with
dedicated operations in the CIL dialect? (me)

A: Currently those are still represented as classes in CIL, but it is
planned. (Vinay)
